Cards have numerous components that can be used to customise the appearance of the card. This section describes each of these components and shows how you can customise an individual card by: Adding an image. Changing how the image fits in the card. Using a background colour, rather than an image Use a video, PowerPoint presentation etc. instead. Adding a date (or date period). Changing the card label. Hiding a card. Enabling \u201cReview Status\u201d. Figure 1 - The default card appearance Types of cards: information and navigation # The Card Interface understands two types of card: information, and navigation. The following table summarises the major differences between the two types of cards. The type of card is determined by the type of its matching Blackboard item. Card Purpose Blackboard Item Information Display small bit of information Content item Navigation Provide a link to and display a small bit of information about another resource Content Folder, Web link, Discussion board, Assessment item or any other Blackboard item that produces a link to another resource Figure 2 shows three cards. The first card is an Information card. The other two cards are Navigation cards. The Information card does not have an engage button as there is nothing to engage with by clicking. It just provides a bit of descriptive text, which in this case talks about the purpose of this page. The two Navigation cards have an engage button if the mouse is placed over these cards, then (as shown by the second card Figure 2) in the entire card will be surrounded by a blue border. Clicking on a _Navigation _card will take the visitor to the link pointed to by the card. Figure 2 - Collection of two different card types The components of a card # Each card can have a number of different components. Each component serves a different purpose and can be used to customise the card. Figure 3 shows a single card with labels identifying each of the major components. The following table provides more detail on each component. Figure 3 - Components of a Card Component Description Image A visual intended to help students connect/associate conceptually and emotionally with the item the card represents. Rather than an image this can be a single background colour. Date Provides an indication to students as to when they should work on the item. Dates can be explicit (Oct 5) or they can be generic and based on the Griffith University calendar (e.g. Week 5) The date also has a Date Label that can be changed. In Figure 3 the date label is Commencing . Label Identifies the type of object the card represents. For Figure 3 the card represents the fifth tutorial. The Card Interface automatically calculates the number. The default label is Module but change be changed. Title Matches the Name of the Blackboard item. Description The Text of the Blackboard item. Engage Provides an additional visual affordance to the viewer that the card is something to be clicked on. The text for this button or whether there is a button can be customised for all cards on the current page. Adding an image # There are two ways to add (or change) an image, by: Image URL (link). Image upload. Image URL (link) # __Pre-requisite: __To use this approach you must know the URL (link) for the image. For example, the URL - https://djon.es/images/GrandCanyon.jpg is for a photo of the Grand Canyon. This page provides some instructions on how to find an image URL using the Google Images . Think twice about using an image URL from the Blackboard content collection This can cause problems when you copy the course for a new offering. How to do it # Edit the content item for the card you with to customise by adding an image. Paste the URL for your image after (and on the same line) as Card Image: (e.g. Figure 4) Save your changes. When you view the page, the card should now be displaying the image from the URL you provided (e.g. Figure 5). Figure 4 - Content item specifying a card image Figure 5 - Card produced by transforming Figure 4 Troubleshooting: My card image doesn\u2019t appear To double check that you have the correct URL for the image, open up a new browser window and paste the image URL into browser location. As a result, your browser should open and display the image. If it doesn\u2019t then your image URL is incorrect. Image upload # If you have a digital copy of the image, but don\u2019t have or would prefer not to use a URL then you can upload the image into the Blackboard item. How to do it # Make sure you have a copy of the image on your computer. Edit the content item for your card. Use these instructions to embed an image in the content item and ensure that the Image Description is Card Image . It is suggested you embed the image at the bottom of the content item to make it easy to edit the other content. Figure 6 shows the same content item as Figure 4, but in this case the image is being uploaded into Blackboard. This content item will produce a card that looks exactly the same as Figure 5. Figure 6 - Content item with image uploaded Changing how the image fits the card # Figure 7 - Card with a cut-off image Not all (or perhaps even many) images will fit neatly into the image space on a card. Some images will be too big. Some too small. Some will have the wrong aspect ratio . For example, Figure 7 shows an image that has been cut off because it is too wide. There are three options you can use to change how the image fits the card Cover (the default); contain; and, manually resize the image. Cover \u2013 the default # By default (you don\u2019t need to do anything for this to happen) the card makes the image \"cover\" the available space. That is, it scales the width and height of the image to ensure there is no unfilled space. If the image aspect ratio is wrong you end up with the problem shown in Figure 7. Some part of the image extends beyond the available space and is invisible (it is cropped). Contain # As an alternative, you can tell the Card Interface to \"contain\" the image. That is, scale the image height and width so that it fits entirely within the space without cropping or stretching. For example, Figure 8. With some images, containing an image will result in an image that is too narrow to take up the full width of a card. When this happens, the image will be centered as shown in Figure 9 Figure 8 - Card using \"contain\" to resize a large image Figure 9 - Card with a centered, contained image How to do it \u2013 contain # To specify that an image should be contained, add the following to the relevant content item. Card Image Size: contain Figure 10 shows an item with this added and how it changes the image. Compare Figure 10 with the same card shown in Figure 5. Figure 10 - Adding \"Card Image Size: contain\" and its impact Manually resize the image # If neither cover nor contain provide a suitable method, you can always manually resize or crop the image to produce an appropriate aspect ratio and size. To do this you will need to use an external tool such as PhotoShop, Paint3D, or one of the free online services . Using a background colour # If you do not want to use an image you can just not specify anything after Card Image: As shown in Figure 1, when there is no image the image space is left white. If you would like to change the background colour, add a valid HTML colour name , a colour hex code , or rgb function after Card Image: For example, Figure 11 shows a card with a red background colour. There are many HTML colour pickers on the Web that can help you choose a colour. Figure 11 - Using a background colour Use a video, PowerPoint presentation etc. instead. # You may prefer to use a YouTube video, PowerPoint presentation or other form of shareable web content. For example, Figure 12 shows a card with a YouTube video instead of a card image. The video can be played, expanded etc from within the card. Figure 12 - Card using a YouTube video rather than an image How to do it # Copy the embed code for the video or other resource you want to use. (e.g. here\u2019s how to get the embed code for a YouTube video ) Edit the Blackboard item matching the card. Change Card Image: to Card Image Iframe: Use the View HTML button on the editor to paste the embed code next to __Card Image Iframe: __For example, Figure 13 has highlighted the embed code for the YouTube video being pasted into the item for Figure 12. Figure 13 - Pasting the embed code for Card Image Iframe Adding a date (or date range) # Each card can had added to it a date or date range. Figure 14, provides three different examples of how card dates might be displayed, including: A \u201cUniversity\u201d date based on the week of a University semester. e.g. the _Overview _card in Figure 14 includes Week 1 and the date Feb 25 . Only Week 1 was provided in the card. __Feb 25 __was automatically calculated based on the particular study period in which this course site was being used. For this study period, Week 1 commenced on Feb 25. Note: This works for the Griffith University schedule. 2. A specific date. e.g. the Content Interface demo _card in Figure 14 does not have a week specified. Instead, the actual date \u2013 __Feb 14__ was provided manually. 3. A date range. e.g. the _Card interface docs card in Figure 14 shows a date range. Starting March 11 and extending to March 25. A date range can be specified using either a University dates or a specific dates. Date Label # Each of the cards in Figure 14 have different date labels \u2013 the text displayed in black at the top of the date, including: Commencing; Celebrating; and, From Figure - Three example card dates Using specific dates # To add a date to a card similar to Figure 14, you add Card Date: Mar 11 as shown in Figure 15. The format for the date is the month followed by the date. The month should be specified as a three-letter abbreviation (e.g. Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec). Figure 15 - Content item for card with date (Figure 14) Using Griffith University dates # Rather than specify an explicit date, it is possible to use Griffith University trimester weeks (as specified by Griffith\u2019s academic calendars ) to specify a date. For example, Figure 16 shows a content item where the card date is specified using Week 1 . Meaning that the first day of Week 1 of the trimester (or study period) associated with the Blackboard course site will be used as the date. Figure 16 - Content item using Griffith University trimester week for date The content item in Figure 16 is converted into the card shown in Figure 17. The Card Interface automatically translates Week 1 into the date for the first day of Week 1 in the appropriate trimester (Trimester 1, 2019). The Card Interface also adds the number of the week to the display to help students and staff. Figure 17 - Card example using Griffith University trimester date Adding a date range # It is possible to specify a date range by providing the start and end dates. These data should be provided in either the Specific date format \u2013 e.g. __Mar 11-Mar 15 __Both dates must be specific using both the abbreviated month and date. Both dates separate by a dash. Trimester week format \u2013 e.g. Week 3-5 __Use the work __Week followed by two numbers (from 1 through 12) separated by a dash. Change the card date label # The cards in both Figure 14 and Figure 17 use the same card label \u2013 Commencing . This is the default card label. To change the card label you add a line containing __Card Date Label: __followed by the new label you wish to use. For example, Figure 18 shows a card with the card date label set to Finish by Figure 18 - Card with different card date label The card in Figure 18 is produced from the content item in Figure 19. Note the line that contains Card Date Label: Finish by Figure 19 - Content item with \"finish by\" card date label How to\u2026use different card types and card labels # Both of the Navigation _cards include a __Card Label__ \u2013 _Module \u2013 and demonstrate the automated numbering of Navigation cards performed by the Card Interface. i.e. in Figure 2 the first navigation card is _Module _1 and the second navigation card is _Module _2 . Changing the card label # As shown in Figure 2, a navigation card can have a card label. By default a navigation card has the label Module . However, the card label can be changed or turned off. Changing the card label # To change the card label, add a line to the description for the Blackboard item that includes Card Label: newLabelName For example, the Blackboard item in Figure 20 specifies a new card label \u2013 Learning path Figure 20 - Blackboard item with different card label Figure 21 shows the Card produced based on the item in Figure 20. Figure 21 - Card with new label name Removing the Card label # If you don\u2019t wish to give a navigation card a label, add to the Blackboard item a line containing Card Label: with an empty label. For example, Figure 22 shows a Blackboard item with an empty Card Label. Figure 22 - Navigation card with an empty label Figure 23 shows the impact of the missing Card Label in the Blackboard item shown in Figure 22. The Blackboard item in Figure 22 is used to produce the card in the middle of Figure 23. The collection of three cards in Figure 23 are the same three cards (with the change made in Figure 22) shown in Figure 2. The change made in Figure 22 creates two changes in Figure 23: First, the middle card no longer has the Module label, or any label at all. Second, the last card now starts as Module 1 , rather than Module 2 in Figure 2. Illustrating that a removing a label from a card results in it being removed from the automated sequencing of labels. Figure 23 - Card collection with empty card label and renumbering How to\u2026hide a card # Sometimes you don\u2019t want a card to appear. e.g. you don\u2019t want students to access a quiz just yet. Since a card is just a different way to visualise a single Blackboard Content Item. You hide the card by hiding the Blackboard Content Item. Hiding a Blackboard Content Item # If you hover your mouse over an item's name an arrow icon should appear. Click on it and you see the list of options (e.g. Figure 24). To make an item unavailable to students, click on the _Make Unavailable _option. Rather than manually make an item available or unavailable, you can use Adaptive Release . One of the other course options shown above (just under Make Unavailable ). Adaptive Release can be used to automate availability. Make it available after a date, between two dates, available only to a particular group....and much more Figure 24 - Options for a Blackboard content item What you will see in edit mode # With _edit mode _on you will still be able to see cards that you have hidden. A card that has been hidden will show a message. As shown in Figure 25. Cards with adaptive release applied will current NOT show any message. Figure 25 - Card for an unavailable item showing the \"hidden\" message What you and students will see when not in edit mode # With _edit mode _off you will see the cards closer to what students see. Cards that are marked unavailable will not be shown. Cards with adaptive release applied will not be shown, if you meet the adaptive release rules.
