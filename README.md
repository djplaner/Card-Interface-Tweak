# Card Interface Tweak

Insert a bit of Javascript into a [Blackboard Learn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_Learn) content area and transform it into a responsive, image rich [card interface](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/10/designing-card-based-user-interfaces/). 


## Documentation

Is a work in progress. Rough early "how-to" instructions below. More [refined documentation available as a Word doc](\\staff.ad.griffith.edu.au\ud\fr\s2986288\Documents\GitHub\Card-Interface-Tweak). Better coming here - real soon now. 

## Origins and rationale

The [following conference paper](https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/) and [associated presetation](https://djon.es/blog/2019/11/28/how-to-share-design-knowledge-in-design-for-digital-learning/) contain more background and theory about this approach

### Before - standard Blackboard 9.1 content page

By default, Blackboard 9.1 provides a vertical list of content items.

(See [larger image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/46279789112/))

### After - responsive, image rich card interface

With a few extra elements added (e.g. an image, a related date etc) the tweak transforms the default Blackboard appearance into a fully responsive and visual card interface.

## Origins and inspiration

This Tweak is inspiried by [the Blackboard Tweaks building block](http://tweaks.github.io/Tweaks/).

## How to use the tweak

Requirements are

1. You have a [Blackboard Learn](https://www.blackboard.com/teaching-learning/learning-management/blackboard-learn) site that you have both the permission and knowledge to edit.
1. You can copy [this tweak.js Javascript file](tweak.js) into that page.
1. You can implement the following instructions.

#### Step 1. Add the Tweak Javascript

For the card transformation to happen on a Blackboard content page, [some Javascript](tweak.js) code needs to be inserted into the content page.

1. Create a new Blackboard content item on your Blackboard content page.
2. When editing this new content item, use [the HTML Code View Button](https://www.cpcc.edu/onlinelearning/resources/blackboard/BbAddEmbedCode.pdf) to open a pop-up window
3. Copy and paste the content of the [tweak.js file](tweak.js) into this pop-up window
4. Save and submit your changes

#### Step 2. Create a space for the cards to appear

The card interface produced by the Tweak needs to appear in a content item on the same content page as the Javascript. 

1. Create a new Blackboard content item titled **Card Interface** 
   Current advice is to leave this content item empty. The tweak will add content to it.
2. Choose the type of card interface you wish by ignoring this step (accept the default) or adding one of the following words after **Card Interface**
    * **vertical** for one card per row with elements of a single card displayed horizontally
    * **by*X*** where *X* is some number specifying how many cards per row (e.g. by2 by4 by5 etc.)
    * **by5no** to have 5 cards per row without any image
    * **noengage** if you'd prefer not to have the "Engage" button appear for content folders
    * **engage="*someLabel*"** if you'd prefer to change "Engage" to "*someLabel*" (you choose what *someLable* is)

#### Step 3. Specify the content item(s)/folder(s) you want to appear as a card

Each Card displayed matches one Blackboard content item (see the images above). You need to tell the tweak code which items you want turned into cards. The tweak code will hide the original content item and produce a card.

1. Add the phrase **Card Image:** (including the colon) to the content item/folder
> It's assumed that only content items or content folders are turned into cards. Each works a little differently. A content item will become an "info card". i.e. providing only information. A content folder will also be clickable. Clicking on a content folder will take the user into the folder.

The following is almost the simplest content item/folder for a card.

![Basic content item](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4804/32690548888_1e3ed76595_n.jpg)

It will produce the following card.

![Transformed card interface](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7836/45650083695_f8c6ce290f_n.jpg)

The title of the content item has become the title of the card, and the content of the content item becomes the card content. **Card Image:** and other "card commands" are removed from the content.

Note: that the card above does not have an image, rather the top of the card is a blank yellow space. 

#### Step 4. Specify the image you want to appear on the card

There are two methods that can be used:

1. Paste/type the URL for an image after **Card Image:**
>  **Card Image: http://djon.es/images/GrandCanyon.jpg**
2. [Insert the image](https://suffolk.screenstepslive.com/s/1050/m/bb9/l/11549-how-do-i-embed-a-picture-or-image-as-part-of-an-item) into the Blackboard content item and ensure that the _Image Description_ for the image is **Card Image**

For example, a content item like the following.

![Content item with image specified](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4885/32690681948_06d899958d_n.jpg)

Will produce a card like this.

![Corresponding card interface](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4853/32690681868_68d40300cf_n.jpg)

#### Step 4. Add a date

Each card can have a date associated with it.

1. Add **Card Date:** as a single line to the content item followed by the relevant date using the MMM DD format

For example, if **Card Date: Mar 4** is added to the content item from the previous steps the card will have a calendar graphic added to the top right of the card.

![Card with a date](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4847/45650359185_305a721313_n.jpg)

#### Step 5. Change the date label

By default, a card date will be preceeded by the label **Commencing**. You can change this.

1. Add **Card Date Label: _Due_** Where you replace _Due_ with whatever word you wish to use.

For example, the following content item

![Content item with new date label](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7810/46564373241_5387dd591c_n.jpg)

will produce the following card

![Card with new date label](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4864/45650359455_4aa522a829_n.jpg)

#### Step 6. Change the card label

If the content item you are adding is either a _Content Folder_ or _Module Page_ (i.e. it links to another Blackboard content page) then card will be labelled (by default) as **Module _X_**. Where **_X_** is replaced a number representing the number of the card. 

For example, the card above has the card label **Module 5**. Meaning it was the 5th card content item on this page. **Module** may not be the label you wish to use.

1. Add a line with **Card Label: _new name_** to the content item
> Replace **_new name_** with the label you wish to use.
> Use an empty label if you don't want a label to appear.

For example, the following content item specifies the use of _Learning path_ as the new card label.
