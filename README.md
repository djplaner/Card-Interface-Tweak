# Card Interface Tweak

Insert a [bit of HTML/CSS/Javascript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djplaner/Card-Interface-Tweak/master/tweak.js) into a [Blackboard Learn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_Learn) content area and transform it into a responsive, image rich [card interface](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/10/designing-card-based-user-interfaces/).

## Documentation

See [the Card Interface documentation site](https://djplaner.github.io/Card-Interface-Tweak/) for more detail on what this is, why you'd want to use it, and how.

When the tweak is added to your Blackboard site, it will include links to the documentation explaining how to perform most common tasks.

## Origins and rationale

The [following conference paper](https://djon.es/blog/2019/08/08/exploring-knowledge-reuse-in-design-for-digital-learning-tweaks-h5p-constructive-templates-and-casa/) and [associated presetation](https://djon.es/blog/2019/11/28/how-to-share-design-knowledge-in-design-for-digital-learning/) contain more background and theory about this approach
