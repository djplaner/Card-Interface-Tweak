Specify which items to appear as a card"},{"location":"customiseACard/","text":"Customise a card # Introduction # Figure 1 is an example of a single default card. An individual card can be customised in different ways as explained below. But first, some explanation of the two types of cards, and the different components that can appear on a card. Figure 1 - The default card appearance Types of cards: information and navigation # The Card Interface understands two types of card: information, and navigation. The following table summarises the major differences between the two types of cards. The type of card is determined by the type of its matching Blackboard item. Card Purpose Blackboard Item Information Display small bit of information Content item Navigation Provide a link to and display a small bit of information about another resource Can have numeric card labaels Content Folder, Web link, Discussion board, Assessment item or any other Blackboard item that produces a link to another resource Figure 2 shows three cards. The first card is an Information card. The other two cards are Navigation cards. The Information card does not have an engage button as there is nothing to engage with by clicking. It just provides a bit of descriptive text, which in this case talks about the purpose of this page. The two Navigation cards have an engage button if the mouse is placed over these cards, then (as shown by the second card Figure 2) in the entire card will be surrounded by a blue border. Clicking on a Navigation card will take the visitor to the link pointed to by the card. Figure 2 - Collection of two different card types The components of a card # Each card can be made up of many different components. Each component serves a different purpose and can be used to customise the card. Figure 3 shows a single card with labels identifying each of the major components. The following table provides more detail on each component. Figure 3 - Components of a Card Component Description Image A visual intended to help students connect/associate conceptually and emotionally with the item the card represents. Rather than an image this can be a single background colour. Date Provides an indication to students as to when they should work on the item. Dates can be explicit (Oct 5) or they can be generic and based on the Griffith University calendar (e.g. Week 5) The date also has a Date Label that can be changed. In Figure 3 the date label is Commencing . Label Identifies the type of object the card represents. For Figure 3 the card represents the fifth tutorial. The Card Interface automatically calculates the number. The default label is Module but change be changed. Title Matches the Name of the Blackboard item. Description The Text of the Blackboard item. Engage Provides an additional visual affordance to the viewer that the card is something to be clicked on. The text for this button or whether there is a button can be customised for all cards on the current page. Adding an image # There are two ways to add (or change) an image, by: Image URL (link). Image upload. Image URL (link) Pre-requisite: To use this approach you must know the URL (link) for the image. For example, the URL - https://djon.es/images/GrandCanyon.jpg is for a photo of the Grand Canyon. You can use Google Images to search for relevant images , or use other images you find online by copying the image URL . Think twice about using an image URL from the Blackboard content collection This can cause problems when you copy the course for a new offering. How to do it Edit the content item for the card you with to customise by adding an image. Paste the URL for your image after (and on the same line) as Card Image: (e.g. Figure 4) Save your changes. When you view the page, the card should now be displaying the image from the URL you provided (e.g. Figure 5). Figure 4 - Content item specifying a card image Figure 5 - Card produced by transforming Figure 4 Troubleshooting: My card image doesn\u2019t appear To double check that you have the correct URL for the image, open up a new browser window and paste the image URL into browser location. As a result, your browser should open and display the image. If it doesn\u2019t then your image URL is incorrect. Image upload If you have a digital copy of the image, but don\u2019t have or would prefer not to use a URL then you can upload the image into the Blackboard item. How to do it Make sure you have a copy of the image on your computer. Edit the content item for your card. Use these instructions to embed an image in the content item and ensure that the Image Description is Card Image . It is suggested you embed the image at the bottom of the content item to make it easy to edit the other content. Figure 6 shows the same content item as Figure 4, but in this case the image is being uploaded into Blackboard. This content item will produce a card that looks exactly the same as Figure 5. Figure 6 - Content item with image uploaded Adding an \u201cactive\u201d image # As shown in Figure 3, one of the possible card components is a date or date range. Suggesting that the information contained by the card is particularly relevant for that date or date range. To reinforce the association between the card and a date it is possible to specify an active image for a card. Normally, the card will display the card image specified in previous sections. If there is an active image specified, the active image will be shown instead when the card is \u201cactive\u201d. i.e. when viewed during its specified date or date range. Note: the date and time a card is being viewed is calculated by the web browser and computer used to view the web page. Hence the current time and date is based on that of the viewer. Given timezones, someone viewing a card from Brisbane may see a different active image than someone viewing the same card from London. For example The following figure (Figure 7) shows a card that has been configured with an active image. Done using the Card Image Active: line. The date for this card has been set to January 12 . The card will be \u201cactive\u201d when viewed on January 12. Figure 7 - A Card content item with a \"Card Image Active\" defined The next two figures are views of this card taken on different days. Figure 8 is what the card looked like on January 11. On January 11, the Card Image was shown. Figure 9 is what the card looked like on January 12. On January 12, the Card Image Active was shown. Figure 8 - Viewed on Jan 11 Figure 9 - Viewed on Jan 12 Possible dates and date ranges The Card Interface supports three different types of dates or date ranges. The following table summarises these possibilities and how they work with the active image. Type of date Example When is the active image displayed? Specific date January 12 Between 12am and 11:59pm on January 12 Griffith University Trimester Week Week 5 Between 12am Monday and 11:59pm Sunday of the week matching week 5 of Griffith trimester for the course site. Date range Jan 12-Jan 14 Between 12am January 12 and 11:59pm January 14 Date range (Griffith) Week 2-Week 4 Between 12am Monday Week 2 and 11:59pm Sunday of Week 4 Changing how the image fits the card # Figure 10 - Card with a cut-off image Not all (or perhaps even many) images will fit neatly into the image space on a card. Some images will be too big. Some too small. Some will have the wrong aspect ratio . For example, Figure 10 shows an image that has been cut off because it is too wide. There are three options you can use to change how the image fits the card Cover (the default); contain; and, manually resize the image. Cover \u2013 the default By default (you don\u2019t need to do anything for this to happen) the card makes the image \"cover\" the available space. That is, it scales the width and height of the image to ensure there is no unfilled space. If the image aspect ratio is wrong you end up with the problem shown in Figure 10. Some part of the image extends beyond the available space and is invisible (it is cropped). Contain As an alternative, you can tell the Card Interface to \"contain\" the image. That is, scale the image height and width so that it fits entirely within the space without cropping or stretching. For example, Figure 11. With some images, containing an image will result in an image that is too narrow to take up the full width of a card. When this happens, the image will be centered as shown in Figure 12 Figure 11 - Card using \"contain\" to resize a large image Figure 12 - Card with a centered, contained image How to do it \u2013 contain To specify that an image should be contained, add the following to the relevant content item. Card Image Size: contain Figure 13 shows an item with this added and how it changes the image. Compare Figure 13 with the same card shown in Figure 5. Figure 13 - Adding \"Card Image Size: contain\" and its impact Manually resize the image If neither cover nor contain provide a suitable method, you can always manually resize or crop the image to produce an appropriate aspect ratio and size. To do this you will need to use an external tool such as PhotoShop, Paint3D, or one of the free online services . Using a background colour # If you do not want to use an image you can just not specify anything after Card Image: As shown in Figure 1, when there is no image the image space is left white. If you would like to change the background colour, add a valid HTML colour name , a colour hex code , or rgb function after Card Image: For example, Figure 14 shows a card with a red background colour. There are many HTML colour pickers on the Web that can help you choose a colour. Figure 14 - Using a background colour Use a video, PowerPoint presentation etc. instead. # You may prefer to use a YouTube video, PowerPoint presentation or other form of shareable web content. For example, Figure 15 shows a card with a YouTube video instead of a card image. The video can be played, expanded etc from within the card. Figure 15 - Card using a YouTube video rather than an image How to do it Copy the embed code for the video or other resource you want to use. (e.g. here\u2019s how to get the embed code for a YouTube video ) Edit the Blackboard item matching the card. Change Card Image: to Card Image Iframe: Use the View HTML button on the editor to paste the embed code next to Card Image Iframe: For example, Figure 16 has highlighted the embed code for the YouTube video being pasted into the item for Figure 15. Figure 16 - Pasting the embed code for Card Image Iframe Adding a date (or date range) # Each card can had added to it a date or date range. Figure 17 - Three example card dates provides three different examples of how card dates might be displayed, including: A \u201cUniversity\u201d date based on the week of a University semester. e.g. the Overview card in Figure 17 includes Week 1 and the date Feb 25 . Only Week 1 was provided in the card. Feb 25 was automatically calculated based on the particular study period in which this course site was being used. For this study period, Week 1 commenced on Feb 25. Note: This works for the Griffith University schedule. A specific date. e.g. the Content Interface demo card in Figure 17 does not have a week specified. Instead, the actual date \u2013 Feb 14 was provided manually. A date range. e.g. the Card interface docs card in Figure 17 shows a date range. Starting March 11 and extending to March 25. A date range can be specified using either a University dates or a specific dates. Date Label Each of the cards in Figure 17 have different date labels \u2013 the text displayed in black at the top of the date, including: Commencing; Celebrating; and, From Figure - Three example card dates Using specific dates To add a date to a card similar to the last card in Figure 17, you add Card Date: Mar 11 as shown in Figure 18. The format for the date is the month followed by the date. The month should be specified as a three-letter abbreviation (e.g. Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec). Figure 18 - Content item for card with date Using Griffith University dates Rather than specify an explicit date, it is possible to use Griffith University trimester weeks (as specified by Griffith\u2019s academic calendars ) to specify a date. For example, Figure 19 shows a content item where the card date is specified using Week 1 . Meaning that the first day of Week 1 of the trimester (or study period) associated with the Blackboard course site will be used as the date. Figure 19 - Content item using Griffith University trimester week for date The content item in Figure 19 is converted into the card shown in Figure 20. The Card Interface automatically translates Week 1 into the date for the first day of Week 1 in the appropriate trimester (Trimester 1, 2019). The Card Interface also adds the number of the week to the display to help students and staff. Figure 20 - Card example using Griffith University trimester date Adding a date range It is possible to specify a date range by providing the start and end dates. These data should be provided in either the Specific date format \u2013 e.g. Mar 11-Mar 15 Both dates must be specific using both the abbreviated month and date. Both dates separate by a dash. Trimester week format \u2013 e.g. Week 3-5 Use the work Week followed by two numbers (from 1 through 12) separated by a dash. Change the card date label Figure 20 is using the default card date label \u2013 Commencing . As shown in Figure 17 it is possible to change the card date label. For example, Figure 21 shows a card with the card date label set to Finish by Figure 21 - Card with different card date label To change the card label you add a line containing Card Date Label: followed by the new label you wish to use. The card in Figure 21 is produced from the content item in Figure 22. Note the line that contains Card Date Label: Finish by Figure 22 - Content item with \"finish by\" card date label Changing the card label # As shown in Figure 3, by default all cards have a label intended to indicate what type of information or object the card provides (information card) or pointing to (navigation card). A card label has two components: name; and By default, the label name is Module , but it can be changed. number. By default, the label number if automatically incremented so that the second \u201cmodule\u201d card has the number 2. See Removing the Card Number below for how to turn off the number. Multiple independently numbered label names now supported Before 2021, the automatic incrementing of numbers would only work for a single label name. i.e. you could have Module or Topic , but not both. It is now possible \u2013 as shown in Figure 23 \u2013 to have multiple labels with each label\u2019s number being automatically incremented separately. Card label example For example, the card interface in Figure 23 illustrates how labels can be used. The first card \u2013 What\u2019s next? \u2013 does not have a card label. Three of the cards have the label Module and are numbered sequentially from one to three. Two other cards have the label Personal Change . Figure - Card Interface showing different labels Changing the card label To change the card label, add a line to the description for the Blackboard item to include Card Label: newLabelName For example, the Blackboard item in Figure 24 is used to produce the Your steps toward becoming a master teacher card in Figure 23. Figure 24 - Blackboard item with different card label Removing the Card label If you don\u2019t wish to give a navigation card a label (e.g. the What\u2019s next? card in Figure 23) you ensure that the Blackboard item contains an empty Card label line. Card Label: For example, the item shown in Figure 25 is used to produce the What\u2019s next? card in Figure 23. Figure 25 - Navigation card with an empty label Changing the Card Number # As shown above, a card label consists of a name and a number. By default, the card number starts at 1 and increments for each card of a given label i.e. Module 1, Module 2, Module 3. The order of numbering is controlled by the order in which the items appear in the Blackboard page. Change the order of items and you will change the numbering Blackboard allows you to change the order of items . Changing the order of items will change the order of numbering. However, the numbering will always start at 1. Reload the page after changing the order Changing the order of items in Blackboard happens in the page. Meaning it does NOT change what you see in the card interface. To see the changes, you will need to reload or refresh the Blackboard page. Use \u201cCard Number\u201d to change the numbering Figure 26 has been modified to change the numbering of the cards shown in Figure 23. Rather than starting at 1. The Module cards start at 55. This was done by adding the following to the What does masterful teaching look like? Card Card Number: 55 This sets the current card\u2019s number to 55 and ensures that all subsequent cards with the same label are numbered incrementally from there (56, 57, 58\u2026) Figure - Example of how card number can be used Removing the card number # As mentioned above a card label typically has two parts: a name and a number. If you wish for the label to include the name, you must remove the card number. This can be two different ways: for a single card; or, for all cards. Remove the card number for a single card For example, the third card in Figure 26 has the label Personal Change 1 . To remove the number ( 1 ) you add to the item description. Card Number: none For example, Figure 27 which produces Figure - Removing the card number from a single card Figure - Example card with a card label, but no card number Remove the card number for all cards If you wish to remove the Card Number from all of the cards with Card Labels, then you add to the title of the card interface element noCardNumber For example, the change in Figure 29 removes all the card numbers from Figure 26 to produce Figure 30. Figure - How to turn off the card number for all cards with labels Figure - All card numbers removed Hiding a card # Sometimes you don\u2019t want a card to appear. e.g. you don\u2019t want students to access a quiz just yet. Since a card is just a different way to visualise a single Blackboard Content Item. You hide the card by hiding the Blackboard item, either by making it unavailable or using adaptive release. Hiding a Blackboard item If you hover your mouse over an item's name an arrow icon should appear. Click on it and you see the list of options (e.g. Figure 31). To make an item unavailable to students, click on the Make Unavailable option. Rather than manually make an item available or unavailable, you can use Adaptive Release . One of the other course options shown above (just under Make Unavailable ). Adaptive Release can be used to automate availability. Make it available after a date, between two dates, available only to a particular group....and much more Figure 31 - Options for a Blackboard content item What you will see in edit mode With edit mode on you will still be able to see cards that you have hidden. A card that has been hidden will show a message. As shown in Figure 32. Cards with adaptive release applied will currently NOT show any message. Figure 32 - Card for an unavailable item showing the \"hidden\" message What you and students will see when not in edit mode With edit mode off you will see the cards closer to what students see. Cards that are marked unavailable will not be shown. Cards with adaptive release applied will not be shown, if you meet the adaptive release rules. For example, if an item is limited only to people in a group. You will only see the matching card if you are in the group. Enabling \u201cReview Status\u201d # \u201cReview Status\u201d is a Blackboard feature that allows students to make particular items as reviewed. It also enables teachers to view what items students have marked as reviewed. \u201cReview Status\u201d is set per item in Blackboard \u2013 see these instructions . With \u201cReview Status\u201d on there are two possible states for an item: Mark Reviewed (Figure 33); and Indicating that the student can mark this item as reviewed Reviewed (Figure 34). Indicating that the student has marked this item as reviewed. The changes to the Card Interface shown in Figure 33 and Figure 34 are only visible when Edit Mode is off.

To change a card, you change the corresponding Blackboard item The following image has two cards. Each card is implemented using its own Blackboard item (only visible with editing on). To make any changes to a card you must make that change to the corresponding Blackboard item. The order in which Cards are displayed is the same as the order of the Blackboard items. Change the order of the Blackboard items and you will change the order of the Cards. Figure 9 - Order of cards is the same as the order of the Blackboard items How to change the order of Blackboard items. With editing turned on it is possible to drag and drop Blackboard items to change their order. This resource from Reading University in the UK illustrates how to rearrange Blackboard items . Remember to refresh the page Changing the order of the Blackboard items using the above method won\u2019t change the order of the cards. This is because the Cards are only displayed when the page is loaded from scratch. Once you\u2019ve finished rearranging the Blackboard items, refresh or reload the web page. Numbering is automatically updated The image below shows the Instrument Cards from above, but re-ordered. The Instrument Cards are using the auto-numbering feature. Each Card has a Card Label \u2013 Instrument \u2013 and each Card has been auto-numbered. Auto-numbering is based on the order of the Blackboard items. Change the order and the auto-number changes.
