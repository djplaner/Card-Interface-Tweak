The following sections work through each of these. Steps 1 and 2 only need to be done once for each Blackboard page on which you want to use the Card Interface. Step 3 is repeated for as many times as you want cards. Pre-requisites \u00b6 The following assumes that you have a Blackboard site for which you have permission to create content. It also assumes that within that course you have a content area or content folder on which you want to use the card interface. Step 1. Add the tweak javascript \u00b6 The Card Interface is implement with some Javascript that transforms the original Blackboard content into the Card Interface. For this to work, the Javascript must be added to the page using the following steps. Copy all of the tweak code on this page into your clipboard. Create a new, empty content item on your designated Blackboard content area/folder (see these instructions for help). It doesn\u2019t matter what name you call this content item. It will not be visible to students. When editing the new content item paste the tweak code into the item using the HTML Code View button . Save and submit your changes.

This section illustrates all the different ways you can customise the appearance of individual cards, including Add an image; Replace the yellow section at the top of the card with an engaging image of your choice. Change the background colour; If you\u2019d prefer not to use an image, change the background of the top of the card from yellow to your choice of colour. Add a date or date range; Specify a date or date range for the card, including the ability to specify the date by referring to a week number from the course site\u2019s trimester. Change the card label If your card is not \u2013 like Figure 1 - for a Module , then change that label or make it disappear. How to\u2026Add a card image by URL \u00b6 The first of two ways you can add a card image is by URL (link). This means that you have found an image that is already on the World-Wide Web and its URL (or link). For example, the URL - https://djon.es/images/GrandCanyon.jpg - is for a photo of the Grand Canyon. __Pre-requisite: __To complete this step, you must have found the URL for the image you want to use. This page provides some instructions on how to find an image URL using the Google Images . Edit the content item for the card you are adding the image to. Paste the URL for your image after (and on the same line) as __Card Image: __Producing something like Figure 2 Save your work When you view the page, the card should now be displaying the image from the URL you provided (e.g. Figure 3). Figure 2 - Content item specifying a card image Figure 3 - Card produced by transforming Figure 2 Troubleshooting: My card image doesn\u2019t appear To double check that you have the correct URL for the image, open up a new browser window and paste the image URL into browser location. As a result, your browser should open and display the image. If it doesn\u2019t then your image URL is incorrect. How to\u2026Add a card image by uploading \u00b6 If you have an image you\u2019d like to use, but can\u2019t find a URL for it you can upload the image to Blackboard and use it there. Make sure you have a copy of the image on your computer. Edit the content item for your card. Use these instructions to embed an image in the content item and ensure that the Image Description is Card Image . It is suggested you embed the image at the bottom of the content item. Figure 4 shows a content item with the image uploaded. This content item will produce a card exactly the same as Figure 3. Figure 4 - Content item with image uploaded How to\u2026make an image fit neatly in a card \u00b6 Figure 5 - Card with a cut-off image Not all (or perhaps even many) images will fit neatly into the image space on a card. Some images will be too big. Some too small. Some will have the wrong aspect ratio . For example, Figure 5 shows an image that has been cut off because it is too wide. There are three options you can use to make an image fit cover; contain; and, manually resize the image. Cover \u2013 the default \u00b6 By default (you don\u2019t need to do anything for this to happen) the card makes the image \"cover\" the available space. That is, it scales the width and height of the image to ensure there is no unfilled space. If the image aspect ratio is wrong you end up with the problem shown in Figure 5. Some part of the image extends beyond the available space and is invisible (it is cropped). Contain \u00b6 As an alternative, you can tell the Card Interface to \"contain\" the image. That is, scale the image height and width so that it fits entirely within the space without cropping or stretching. For example, Figure 6. With some images, containing an image will result in an image that is too narrow to take up the full width of a card. When this happens, the image will be centered as shown in Figure 7 Figure 6 - Card using \"contain\" to resize a large image Figure - Card with a centered, contained image Manually resize the image \u00b6 If neither cover nor contain provide a suitable method, you can always manually resize or crop the image to produce an appropriate aspect ratio and size. To do this you will need to use an external tool such as PhotoShop, Paint3D, or one of the free online services . How to\u2026use no image and a background colour \u00b6 If you do not want to use an image you can just not specify anything after Card Image: For example, Figure 8 shows what happens when no image is specified. The left hand side shows the Content Item with Card Image: blank. The right hand side shows the resulting card with a dark grey colour where the image would have appeared. Figure 8 - Example card with default background colour when no image specified Insert first card image here Changing background colour \u00b6 If you would like to change the background colour, add a valid HTML colour name , a colour hex code , or rgb function . Figure 9__ provides three example cards with different colours specified using different means. The first card (from the left) uses a HTML colour name \u2013 __lightsalmon . The second card uses a hex code - #ff0000 . The last card uses a rgb function \u2013 rgb(0,255,255) . There are many HTML colour pickers on the Web that can help you choose a colour. Figure 9 - Three cards illustrating the three methods to change the default background colour How to\u2026Add or change dates \u00b6 To provide learners with guidance about when they should attend to a card, each card can have a specific date (or date range) associated with it. Figure 10, provides three different examples of how card dates might be displayed. Figure 10 - Card with a date Card Components for Dates \u00b6 There are two components to adding a date to a card: Card Date; and, Must be provided and specifies the date or date range for the card. The three cards in Figure 10 have the following Card Dates Week 1 Specifies the Monday of Griffith University\u2019s week 1 for the current trimester. Feb 14 A specific date. Week 3-5 Specify a date range by separating the trimester week\u2019s with a dash. The same can be done with specific dates e.g. Mar 11-Mar 25 Card Date Label. Specifies the label displayed at the top of the date. In Figure 10 there are three visible card date labels: Commencing , Celebrating , and From . Commencing is the default. See the following sections for more information on how to add dates to card and change the card date label. Adding a specific date to a card \u00b6 To add a date to a card similar to Figure 10, you add Card Date: Mar 11 as shown in Figure 11. The format for the date is the month followed by the date. The month should be specified as a three-letter abbreviation (e.g. Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec). Figure 11 - Content item for card with date ( Figure 10) Add the date using Griffith University trimester weeks \u00b6 Rather than specify an explicit date, it is possible to use Griffith University trimester weeks (as specified by Griffith\u2019s academic calendars ) to specify a date. For example, Figure 12 shows a content item where the card date is specified using Week 1 . Meaning that the first day of Week 1 of the trimester (or study period) associated with the Blackboard course site will be used as the date. Figure 12 - Content item using Griffith University trimester week for date The content item in Figure 12 is converted into the card shown in Figure 13. The Card Interface automatically translates Week 1 into the date for the first day of Week 1 in the appropriate trimester (Trimester 1, 2019). The Card Interface also adds the number of the week to the display to help students and staff. Figure 13 - Card example using Griffith University trimester date Adding a date range \u00b6 It is possible to specify a date range by providing the start and end dates. These data should be provided in either the Specific date format \u2013 e.g. __Mar 11-Mar 15 __Both dates must be specific using both the abbreviated month and date. Both dates separate by a dash. Trimester week format \u2013 e.g. Week 3-5 __Use the work __Week followed by two numbers (from 1 through 12) separated by a dash. Change the card date label \u00b6 The cards in both Figure 10 and Figure 13 use the same card label \u2013 Commencing . This is the default card label. To change the card label you add a line containing __Card Date Label: __followed by the new label you wish to use. For example, Figure 14 shows a card with the card date label set to Finish by Figure 14 - Card with different card date label The card in Figure 14 is produced from the content item in Figure 15. Note the line that contains Card Date Label: Finish by Figure 15 - Content item with \"finish by\" card date label How to\u2026use different card types and card labels \u00b6 The Card Interface understands two types of card: information, and navigation. The following table summarises the major differences between the two types of cards. Card Purpose Blackboard Item Affordances Information Display small bit of information Content item Displays information, no link, Card label and Engage button NOT displayed. Navigation Provide a link to and display a small bit of information about another resource Content Folder, Web link, Discussion board, Assessment item or any other Blackboard item that produces a link to another resource Displays card information and links to the other resource. Card label displayed. Engage button displayed. Figure 16 shows three cards. The first card is an Information card. The other two cards are Navigation cards. The Information card does not have an engage button as there is nothing to engage with by clicking. It just provides a bit of descriptive text, which in this case talks about the purpose of this page. The two Navigation cards have an engage button if the mouse is placed over these cards, then (as shown by the second card Figure 16) in the entire card will be surrounded by a blue border. Clicking on a Navigation card will take the visitor to the link pointed to by the card. Both of the Navigation cards include a Card Label \u2013 Module \u2013 and demonstrate the automated numbering of Navigation cards performed by the Card Interface. i.e. in Figure 16 the first navigation card is Module 1 and the second navigation card is Module 2 . Figure 16 - Collection of two different card types Changing the card label \u00b6 As shown in Figure 16, a navigation card can have a card label. By default a navigation card has the label Module . However, the card label can be changed or turned off. Changing the card label \u00b6 To change the card label, add a line to the description for the Blackboard item that includes Card Label: newLabelName For example, the Blackboard item in Figure 17 specifies a new card label \u2013 Learning path Figure 17 - Blackboard item with different card label Figure 18 shows the Card produced based on the item in Figure 17. Figure 18 - Card with new label name Removing the Card label \u00b6 If you don\u2019t wish to give a navigation card a label, add to the Blackboard item a line containing Card Label: with an empty label. For example, Figure 19 shows a Blackboard item with an empty Card Label. Figure 19 - Navigation card with an empty label Figure 20 shows the impact of the missing Card Label in the Blackboard item shown in Figure 19. The Blackboard item in Figure 19 is used to produce the card in the middle of Figure 20. The collection of three cards in Figure 20 are the same three cards (with the change made in Figure 19) shown in Figure 16. The change made in Figure 19 creates two changes in Figure 20: First, the middle card no longer has the Module label, or any label at all. Second, the last card now starts as Module 1 , rather than Module 2 in Figure 16. Illustrating that a removing a label from a card results in it being removed from the automated sequencing of labels. Figure 20 - Card collection with empty card label and renumbering How to\u2026hide a card \u00b6 Sometimes you don\u2019t want a card to appear. e.g. you don\u2019t want students to access a quiz just yet. Since a card is just a different way to visualise a single Blackboard Content Item. You hide the card by hiding the Blackboard Content Item. Hiding a Blackboard Content Item \u00b6 If you hover your mouse over an item's name an arrow icon should appear. Click on it and you see the list of options (e.g. Figure 21). To make an item unavailable to students, click on the Make Unavailable option. Rather than manually make an item available or unavailable, you can use Adaptive Release . One of the other course options shown above (just under Make Unavailable ). Adaptive Release can be used to automate availability. Make it available after a date, between two dates, available only to a particular group....and much more Figure - Options for a Blackboard content item What you will see in edit mode \u00b6 With edit mode on you will still be able to see cards that you have hidden. A card that has been hidden will show a message. As shown in Figure 22. Cards with adaptive release applied will current NOT show any message. Figure - Card for an unavailable item showing the \"hidden\" message What you and students will see when not in edit mode \u00b6 With edit mode off you will see the cards closer to what students see. Cards that are marked unavailable will not be shown. Cards with adaptive release applied will not be shown, if you meet the adaptive release rules. For example, if an item is limited only to people in a group. You will only see the matching card if you are in the group.","title":"Customise a card"},{"location":"customiseACard/#introduction","text":"Figure 1 - Example default card The example default card shown in Figure 1 is not very appealing.

Clicking on a Navigation card will take the visitor to the link pointed to by the card. Both of the Navigation cards include a Card Label \u2013 Module \u2013 and demonstrate the automated numbering of Navigation cards performed by the Card Interface. i.e. in Figure 16 the first navigation card is Module 1 and the second navigation card is Module 2 .

However, the Card Interface also allows you to modify how the card interface is displayed. It allows you to display the same collection of Blackboard items in very different ways. This document introduces you to the current possibilities and how to use them. Figure 1 - The default \"rows of 3\" card interface How to customise \u2013 Templates and Attributes \u00b6 The Card Interface supports two types of customisation that impact the entire interface. Templates; and, Influencing how the cards are organised on the page. Card attributes. Influencing card appearance, e.g. what buttons appear and the labels for those buttons. While they are used in similar ways, they modify different parts of the interface. The following two sub-sections summarise the two types of customisation. The rest of this document illustrates how to use them and provides examples. Adding parameters to the Card Interface item\u2019s title \u00b6 Both types of customisation are used by adding the appropriate parameters to the Name of the Card Interface item. For example Figure 2 shows the Card Interface item being edited, and the Name element having two parameters engage=Start \u2013 An attribute to change the label for the engage button to Start . template=by4 \u2013 A layout parameter that will result in the Card Interface being displayed in rows of 4 cards. Figure - Adding parameters to the title of the Card Interface item Templates \u00b6 The organisation of cards into rows of individual cards \u2013 3 to a row \u2013 in Figure 1 is the default card layout.

The 4 can be replaced with any whole number from 1 through 6. template=assessment Use a special card design \u2013 designed specifically for assessment items \u2013 to display cards one per row template=vertical Show only one card per row. The cards are show vertically with the image displaying to the left hand end of the card. Note: This template is not currently working well. Attributes \u00b6 It\u2019s also possible to specify certain parameters that will be applied to each card and change attributes of the cards. Example Description noengage Don\u2019t display the engage button engage=\u2019Some word\u2019 Replace the Engage button label with Some word markReviewed=\u2019Check Completed\u2019 Change the Mark Reviewed button label to Check Completed .

How to arrange cards vertically using template=vertical? \u00b6 The vertical __customisation of the Card Interface aims to display cards vertically. i.e. one card per row. By adding __vertical to the name of the Card Interface item (as shown in Error! Reference source not found. ) the card interface shown in Figure 1 is transformed into Figure 3. Figure 3 - Vertical Card Interface How to change the number of cards per row using template=b1y[123456]? \u00b6 Change how many cards per row. By default 3, to display 5 cards per row (rather than 3), add template=by5 to the name of the Card Interface Blackboard item. Figure 4 shows a by5 card display based on the same Card Interface shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3. template=by1 will display 1 card per row.

Changes you can make to the engage button, include: Remove the engage button; or, Change the label displayed on the button. Remove the engage button - noengage \u00b6 Figure 6 displays the card interface almost exactly the same as the default display. Three cards to a row with images. The main difference is that it does NOT display the engage button on each card.
